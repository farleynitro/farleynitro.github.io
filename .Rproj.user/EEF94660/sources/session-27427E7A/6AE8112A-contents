## So far, struggling a little bit ####

Things tend to go slow for several reasons:

> I just want to get started with the projects!

1. Program interface (to zoom or not to zoom?)
2. Disbalance in student expertise


3. I just want to get started with the projects!Or the hardcore (new) theory. I believe reviewing old material is to be done in someone's own time. Well, that's how my uni went so I am used to the stress hahaha. It is also just part of my natural character. Because of this, I am excited for **what is to come...**

### Finished taller de R ###

Experience:
+ Not very different to Python
+ Need to get used to the syntax
+ Actually pretty easy to use. The interface is insanely simple
+ I am scared some solutions I will not know because of a lack of dominance of R. **Hopefully we can help each other with this.**


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
